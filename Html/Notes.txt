HTML <!--...--> Tag
The comment tag is used to insert comments in the source code.


The <!DOCTYPE html> declaration defines that this document is an HTML5 document
The <html> element is the root element of an HTML page
The <head> element contains meta information about the HTML page
The <title> element specifies a title for the HTML page (which is shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab)
The <body> element defines the document's body, and is a container for all the visible contents, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.
The <h1> element defines a large heading
The <p> element defines a paragraph

An HTML element is defined by a start tag, some content, and an end tag:
<tagname> Content goes here... </tagname>

The <pre> tag defines preformatted text. Text in a <pre> element is displayed in a fixed-width font, and the text preserves both spaces and line breaks. 
The text will be displayed exactly as written in the HTML source code.

All HTML elements can have attributes
The href attribute of <a> specifies the URL of the page the link goes to
The src attribute of <img> specifies the path to the image to be displayed
The width and height attributes of <img> provide size information for images
The alt attribute of <img> provides an alternate text for an image
The style attribute is used to add styles to an element, such as color, font, size, and more
The lang attribute of the <html> tag declares the language of the Web page
The title attribute defines some extra information about an element


Use the style attribute for styling HTML elements
Use background-color for background color
Use color for text colors

Notes on GET:

Appends the form data to the URL, in name/value pairs
NEVER use GET to send sensitive data! (the submitted form data is visible in the URL!)
The length of a URL is limited (2048 characters)
Useful for form submissions where a user wants to bookmark the result
GET is good for non-secure data, like query strings in Google

Notes on POST:

Appends the form data inside the body of the HTTP request (the submitted form data is not shown in the URL)
POST has no size limitations, and can be used to send large amounts of data.
Form submissions with POST cannot be bookmarked

The HTML tables are created using the <table> tag in which the 
<tr> tag is used to create table rows and 
<td> tag is used to create data cells. 
The elements under <td> are regular and left aligned by default

the border is an attribute of <table> tag and it is used to put a border across all the cells. 
If you do not need a border, then you can use border = "0".

Table Heading
Table heading can be defined using <th> tag. This tag will be put to replace <td> tag, 
which is used to represent actual data cell.
